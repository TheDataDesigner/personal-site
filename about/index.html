    <h2>I guess I'll start at the beginning</h2>
    <p>I was born on November 1st, 1989 in Harrisburg PA. As a child I was always interested in creating things; I was obsessed with legoâ€™s, especially Mind Storms, and sketching level designs for a game that was clearly a ripoff of Half-Life 1, but I was proud of it anyway. I was more interested in talking with adults than I was with kids my own age, even at 5 or 6.</p>
    <p>My interest in drawing and design sharpened throughout highschool, as I gobbled up all the electives I could get my hands on: 2 years of architectural drawing, darkroom photography and some basic graphic design classes. I worked as the graphic designer on the yearbook team. In my own time, I built crappy websites in Dreamwever, dabbled in MySQL and PHP, and spent a decent amount of time building maps for multiplayer games on Valve's Source engine.</p>
    <p>I went to a small central PA college that had a pretty decent art program. As a liberal arts school, I was exposed to many topics while I was there, and by the time graduation came around, I had studied everything from chemistry and educational psychology, logic and philosophy, to accounting and marketing. Some of that information I'll never use again, but a lot of it got assimilated into my primary domains of interest and inform my creativity and design.</p>
    <p>Within a month of graduating college, I had landed an internship at the best design firm in the region, Andculture. At the end of that summer, I had convinced them to hire me full time as a designer, where I still work to this day. I learned as much in the first 6 months here as I did in all of my college experience, and continued to learn more every day.</p>
    <p>I became increasingly interested in digital product design and was given ample opportunity to act on those interests. Throughout the past couple years at Andculture, I have had the opportunity to build a government intranet, a visual data analytics dashboard for a hospital, our own proprietary development platform and CMS, as well as countless other smaller projects, prototypes, and experiments.</p>
    <p>In the future, I hope to continue building products that solve real problems and explore the intersections of art, design, technology, and culture.</p>
